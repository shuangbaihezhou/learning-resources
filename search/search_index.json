We look forward to working with you in building an open and collaborative community as we explore the cryosphere using ICESat-2 datasets. Quick Links Here are some quick links to material for our upcoming June 2020 event: hackweek schedule : overview of our planned virtual events spanning June 8 - 18, 2020. preliminary work : everything you need to know to be ready for the hackweek. What is a hackweek? Hackweeks were originally designed by the University of Washington's eScience Institute , and they aim to provide a welcoming learning environment where you can learn new software tools, collaborate with colleagues, build community and make progress on specific projects. Our hackweek model is constantly evolving and we invite you actively participate as we experiment with new approaches and ideas. Why have a virtual hackweek? The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has required us to rethink and redesign how we offer hackweeks. Community building, networking and peer learning are core elements of our hackweek mission. As an organizing team we are exploring new ways that we can still achieve these goals in a virutal hackweek. We invite all participants to join us as we experiment in various ways, and to recognize that as a community we are all figuring this out as we go along. Roadmap This documentation will act as your primary resource for navigating the logistics, scheduling, tutorials and project work within the hackweek. Here is a general roadmap of our event: Introductory Session : We will begin our virtual time together with an introductory zoom call during which we will share our Code of Conduct and intentions for a positive Learning Community . We will take some time to connect with each other with some facilitated conversations. We will describe the Virtual Technology that we will be using and discuss virtual etiquette . Pre-event Tutorials : We will work through tutorials on Git/GitHub and Python/iPtyhon/Jupyter . Project Preparation : Just before our main hacking event, we will gather together virutally to pitch project ideas and begin to form project teams. We will also provide guidance on project expectations and on how to form healthy team interactions in a virtual setting. Hackweek : Our core event will be offered during the same week we intended to run our in-person hackweek, but will be scaled back to 4 days (June 15-18), and the daily duration will be shorter. Each day will begin with a tutorial session and group check-in, prior to an open hacking session. We will work with groups to schedule some time that most or all group members can work collaboratively. Members of our planning team will be available at designated times to work directly with each project. Surveys and Feedback : Immediately after the event we will do a group debriefing session: What went well? What could be improved next time? Post-event Tutorials : If time and energy permit, we will continue to co-create tutorials and educational opportunities after the event, especially for those who wish to dig into more advanced topics. We will try to offer regular office hours to follow up on core concepts. We can also explore ways to keep momentum going on projects. General Structure As an organizing team, our primary commit to participants is to create inclusive, positive learning spaces that are as accessible to as many participants as possible. Here are some ways we plan to do this: we will teach our core tutorials in two stages: we will offer a 60-90 minute training that will be recorded. Instructors will work through examples and there will be some interactive work. Participants unable to attend the live training can work through content at their own pace. each tutorial will be followed up with question-and-answer sessions. We will try to host several sessions per tutorial, depending on instructor availabilty. Peer-learning will be encouraged, and each session will be moderated. all tutorials will be created using interactive coding examples in Jupyter Notebooks all participants will have continuous access to a shared, web-accessible computational environment through the duration of the event. each zoom session will be moderated by at least two hackweek organizers. A professional facilitator will assist in designing and moderating many sessions, including the virtual project work. we will offer individual and group support mechanisms to help navigate technical and social challenges as they arise. we will check-in frequently with groups and individuals through virtual stand-ups, anonymous polling and other mechanisms in order to engage with people on all levels of proficiency we will have zoom spaces dedicated to social exchanges, music, art and other restorative activities we will take breaks and encourage self-care and rest","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Welcome to the ICESat-2 hackweek!

What is a learning community? We believe that the complicated challenges emerging for scientists and society in the 21st century require us to go beyond traditional educational structures, and that fostering a welcoming learning community is one way we can address these challenges. For the purpose of our hackweeks, we define a learning community as a group of individuals who, motivated by an inherent curiosity and commitment to seeking the truth, freely choose to work together on something they care about. Learning communities thrive when their members adhere to the following guidelines. We invite you to help us create a healthy learning environment by returning to these guidelines throughout the week. Listen for understanding Listening to others is one of the best ways we can build connection and community, but there are many ways to listen. Listening to understand others first \u2013 and not for how to craft your response \u2013 will leave space for new ideas and connections to emerge. Speak your perspectives in ways that respect other people\u2019s perspectives It is important to create an environment where everyone is free to speak openly so that learning can occur. But speaking one\u2019s perspective does not mean interpreting, correcting or debating what others say. Before speaking, think about what it is that you want others to know. Use \"I\" statements with an awareness that what you are saying represents your perspective only. Experience discomfort At hackweeks we challenge ourselves and others to explore new dimensions of learning and team dynamics. This can be a messy process that pushes us outside of our comfort zone. We support you in taking risks and leaning in to challenging conversations, knowing that innovation and growth often emerges from uncomfortable situations. Expect and accept non-closure At times we may succeed in resolving a conflict with another person, but more times than not, it will feel unfinished. Sometimes you will have to circle back to reconcile differences, and other times you will have to sit with non-closure. No fixing It is human nature to want to fix other people\u2019s discomfort, particularly when they are clearly distressed. However, it\u2019s important that we let people experience their emotions without offering unsolicited advice. Stay engaged Discomfort and anxiety are normal parts of courageous conversations. When you start to tune out, return to the topic. Resist the urge to change the subject or make a distracting joke when you are uncomfortable. Instead, ask questions from a place of genuine curiosity. Recognize contributions Traditional academic metrics may not fully recognize the many ways individuals contribute to our learning community. In tutorials, projects, group presentations and code repositories, set up a mutually-agreed upon system for attribution of ideas and effort. When in doubt, ask each other if they approve of the ways in which you plan to use and build on their ideas and content.","title":"Learning Community"},{"location":"conduct/community/#learning-community","text":"Creating a positive learning community for inclusive innovation.

Establishing protocols and habbits around virtual etiquette is important early in the hackweek. Whenever a group is meeting for the first time it is helpful to provide reminders on the following points (these could be posted on a slide that is shared on everyone's screen): keeping video turned on : invite everyone to stay visually connected with their video enabled. You may wish to establish a shared understanding that if someone's vido is off, it means they are taking a break. This protocol can be flexible considering some people may not have a functioning video connection. mute when not speaking : this is especially relevant with many households having multiple adults working from home, and children being home from school. Remind participants to unmute when it is time for them to speak. name and location label : most virtual platforms allow you to show your name somewhere next to your video window. If not already done, teach participants how to update their full name, together with their geographic location if relevant. stating name before speaking : in the event that people are attending without video, advise participants to speak their name first, as is common in an audio-only conference. chat function : explain how to access the chat window, and remind people about the differences between chats with individuals versus the full group. You may wish to establish norms around the use of chat. In some cases, you might want to discourage it since it can be distracting. gallery and speaker views : many platforms offer different ways to view the group of people who are online. For example, Zoom has a speaker and a gallery view. For large groups, gallery may be recommended. Note that the maximum size of the gallery view can be modified in Zoom. security considerations : The rapid uptick in Zoom usage has led to some unfortunate events, so-called \"Zoom bombs\" where unauthorized attendees distrupt an existing meeting.

You will likely also want to have a functioning version of Python on your local laptop if that is not already in place. So this lesson takes you through our recommended procedure for doing that. We suggest you get this set up in advance so that we can help you troubleshoot when you arrive. Python Software Python software is distributed as a series of libraries that are called within your code to perform certain tasks. There are many different collections, or distributions of Python software. Generally you install a specific distribution of Python and then add additional libraries as you need them. There are also several different versions of Python. The two main versions right now are 2.7 and 3.7, although Python 2.7 will not be supported past 2020. Some libraries only work with specific versions of Python. So even though Python is one of the most adaptable, easy-to-use software systems, you can see there are still complexities to work out and potential challenges when delivering content to a large group. Therefore we have a number of different ways that we are trying to simplify this process to maximize your learning during the hackweek. We also provide instructions for using Anaconda , which is our recommended Python distribution, for installing and working with Python on your local computer. We can assist in setting up \"conda\" environments that will simplify the gathering of Python libraries and version specific to the tutorial you are working on. What is Conda? Conda is an open source package and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages, their dependencies and switching easily between them. Conda works with many programming languages but is very popular in the python community. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows. Installing Miniconda Windows Click here to download the proper installer for your Windows platform (64 bits). We recommend to download the Python 3 version of Miniconda. You can still create Python 2 environments using the Python 3 version of Miniconda. When installing, you will be asked if you wish to make the Anaconda Python your default Python for Windows. If you do not have any other installation that is a good option. If you want to keep multiple versions of python on your machine (e.g. ESRI-supplied python, or 64 bit versions of Anaconda), then don't select the option to modify your path or modify your windows registry settings. Linux and OS X You may follow manual steps from here similar to the instructions on Windows (see above). Alternatively, you can execute these commands on a terminal shell (in this case, the bash shell): # For MacOSX url=https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh # For Linux url=https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh wget $url -O miniconda.sh bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda export PATH=\"$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH\" conda update conda --yes Installing Anaconda (Optional) If you don't want all of Anaconda If you don't have time or disk space for the entire distribution do not install Anaconda. Install only Miniconda , a bootstrap version of Anaconda, which contains only Python, essential packages, and conda. We will provide an environment file to install all the packages necessary for the hackweek.* Anaconda is a data science platform that comes with a lot of packages. At its core, Anaconda uses the conda package management system. The list of packages included can be found here . To install Anaconda, please click on the link below for your operating system, and follow the instructions on the site . Once Anaconda installation step is finished run python in the command line to test if Anaconda is installed correctly. Note: For windows, please use the Anaconda prompt as the command line. It should be installed with your installation of Anaconda . If Anaconda is installed correctly, you should have this prompt, which emphasizes Anaconda : $ python Python 3.7.3|Anaconda custom (x86_64)| (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17) ... Installing Python We will be using Python 3.6 or 3.7 during the week (either will work). Since Anaconda (on Linux) expects you to work in the bash shell, if this is not already your default shell, you need to set it to be so (use the chsh -s /bin/bash command to change your default shell to bash) or just run an instance of bash from the command line before issuing \"Conda\" commands ( /bin/bash or where it is located on your system). If you are already familiar with Python 2.7, you can take a look at the syntax differences here , but the main point to remember is to put the print statements in parentheses: print('Hello World!') $ conda create -n py37 python=3.7 To use Python 3.7: $ conda activate py37 To check if you have the correct version: $ python --version","title":"Python installation"},{"location":"preliminary/conda/#python-installation","text":"","title":"Python Installation"},{"location":"preliminary/conda/#overview","text":"What happens after the event when you want to go home and work with all the libraries ?

GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, enabling us to share code across teams in a web environment. What if I do not have the git command on my local machine? If you don't have Git installed on you local machine, you can download the latest installer on Git-SCM . More help for the install process can be found in the official Git documentation Why do I need a GitHub account? There are three reasons you are required to have a GitHub account for the hackweek: We use GitHub credentialing to give everyone access to our cloud computing resources All of our tutorials and project work will be shared on GitHub You will want a GitHub account to practice everything you'll be learning during the Git/GitHub tutorials So, if you don't already have a GitHub account, just navigate to GitHub : Then, click on the big green button and then answer a few required questions. Be sure to save your password somewhere safe because you will need it later! Why are we joining a GitHub Organization? GitHub organizations are a convenient way for teams to get all content relevant to a specific project our workshop into one place. By having everything in one central location you will spend less time searching for hackweek content. GitHub organizations have 'teams' that offer simple ways to provide respository access to groups of people, rather than individuals. We have created a GitHub organization called ICESat-2 hackweek . For security purposes you can only join the organization by invitation. Here are the steps: Once you have a GitHub ID, send it to Jane Koh on our Slack channel We will then find your ID and send you an invitation which should generate an email notification to the email you provided when you signed up for GitHub Follow the links in the email to accept the invitation How should I configure my GitHub account? As you'll learn in the next lesson, we will use the ICESat-2 hackweek GitHub organization as a way to manage access to our cloud computing resources. In order for this to work each person must have public, rather than private membership in the ICESat-2hackweek organization. First, navigate to the \"People\" tab on the ICESat-2 hackweek GitHub organization and find yourself: Now, if you see \"Private\" to the right of your account, you will need to switch this to \"Public\": The steps for doing this are also well documented on this GitHub help page. How will GitHub repositories be structured? When you click on the \"Repositories\" tab in the ICESat-2 hackweek GitHub Organization you will see a list of names, each of which links to a separate GitHub repository: Each repository is a container for a specific subset of material for this event.

Teaching software to a diverse group of participants, each with different computers and operating systems, can be challenging. As you'll learn in the next lesson, there are specific ways to configure our software for the tutorials to be successful, so it takes time to get everyone set up consistently. Our solution to this is to give everyone access to a cloud computing environment that is pre-configured for the specific software we will deploy. This cloud computing instance can be accessed from any web browser, which eliminates the need for configuring each person's individual computer. We will encourage you to use our shared resources for all the tutorials, and you can optionally use this for your projects as well. We also hope you will practice installing Python libraries locally on your laptop so that you can continue working after leaving our event (see our next lesson for details). How do I access the shared cloud environment? Access to our shared cloud environment is easy. Just click on http://icesat-2.hackweek.io/ . Assuming you set up your GitHub credentials correctly (see the previous lesson), you can now click on the \"Sign in with GitHub\" button. Then, authorize the OAuth app to connect to your GitHub account. You will be put back to a page that shows a single image choice for your server. Click \"Start\" to launch your JupyterLab server! It will take a little bit of time for this to load - be patient! Once things are spun up you will see your very own instance of a JupyterLab environment: What is Pangeo and how is this system configured? Pangeo is a community of researchers building open, reproducible and scalable scientific software tools. Several of us are involved in projects with NASA and NSF to build prototype systems to enable data discovery in the era of expanding data volume and complexity. For this hackweek, we have created virtual computing instances on Amazon Web Services that can be deployed on demand in a parallel computing environment. We use JupyterHub as a way to give a Jupyter Notebook server to each person in a group. These slides give a nice overview of what JupyterHub is all about. We use JupyterHub in an educational setting because it enables us to quickly begin working with code without spending time to get the necessary libraries and dependencies set up on everyone's individual computers. How do I get my code in and out of Pangeo? When you start your own instance of Pangeo you will have access to your own virtual drive space. No other Pangeo users will be able to see or access your data files. You can easily upload files to your virtual drive space and save files from Pangeo back to another location, such as GitHub or your own local laptop drive. Here we'll show you how to pull (copy) some files from GitHub into your virtual drive space using git. This will be a common task during the hackweek: at the start of each tutorial we'll ask you to \"fork\" (create your own copy of in your GitHub account) and \"clone\" (make a copy of in a computing environment, such as your local computer or Pangeo instance) the GitHub repository corresponding to the specific tutorial being taught into your Pangeo drive space. To clone (copy) a code repository from GitHub, we will need to interface with the file system of Pangeo. Pangeo is deployed in a Linux operating system and we will need to open a terminal within Pangeo to manage our files. There are two ways to do this: (1) Navigate to the \"File\" menu, choose \"New\" and then \"Terminal\" or (2) click on the \"terminal\" button in JupyterLab: This will open a new terminal tab in your JupyterLab interface: Now you can issue any Linux commands to manage your local file system. Now let's clone a repository (Note: we'll be teaching about Git clone during our introductory tutorials). This tutorial is built in a repository called \"preliminary\", so let's try cloning that. First, navigate in a browser on your own computer to the repository link here . Next, click on the green \"clone or download\" button and then copy the url into your clipboard by clicking the copy button: Now navigate back to your command line in JupyterLab. Type \"git clone\" and then paste in the url: A note about cutting and pasting Pasting something from your clipboard into the Pangeo terminal requires holding down the \"shift\" key and right-clicking. This is different from the usual Linux method that only requires a right click. After issuing the Git clone command you should see something like this: You may also upload files from your local system using the upload button (up-pointing arrow) on the top left of the JupyterHub navigation panel.

As you'll learn in the next lesson, there are specific ways to configure our software for the tutorials to be successful, so it takes time to get everyone set up consistently. Our solution to this is to give everyone access to a cloud computing environment that is pre-configured for the specific software we will deploy. This cloud computing instance can be accessed from any web browser, which eliminates the need for configuring each person's individual computer. We will encourage you to use our shared resources for all the tutorials, and you can optionally use this for your projects as well. We also hope you will practice installing Python libraries locally on your laptop so that you can continue working after leaving our event (see our next lesson for details).","title":"Why are we using a shared cloud environment?"},{"location":"preliminary/jupyterhub/#how-do-i-access-the-shared-cloud-environment","text":"Access to our shared cloud environment is easy.

Several of us are involved in projects with NASA and NSF to build prototype systems to enable data discovery in the era of expanding data volume and complexity. For this hackweek, we have created virtual computing instances on Amazon Web Services that can be deployed on demand in a parallel computing environment. We use JupyterHub as a way to give a Jupyter Notebook server to each person in a group. These slides give a nice overview of what JupyterHub is all about. We use JupyterHub in an educational setting because it enables us to quickly begin working with code without spending time to get the necessary libraries and dependencies set up on everyone's individual computers.","title":"What is Pangeo and how is this system configured?"},{"location":"preliminary/jupyterhub/#how-do-i-get-my-code-in-and-out-of-pangeo","text":"When you start your own instance of Pangeo you will have access to your own virtual drive space. No other Pangeo users will be able to see or access your data files. You can easily upload files to your virtual drive space and save files from Pangeo back to another location, such as GitHub or your own local laptop drive. Here we'll show you how to pull (copy) some files from GitHub into your virtual drive space using git. This will be a common task during the hackweek: at the start of each tutorial we'll ask you to \"fork\" (create your own copy of in your GitHub account) and \"clone\" (make a copy of in a computing environment, such as your local computer or Pangeo instance) the GitHub repository corresponding to the specific tutorial being taught into your Pangeo drive space. To clone (copy) a code repository from GitHub, we will need to interface with the file system of Pangeo. Pangeo is deployed in a Linux operating system and we will need to open a terminal within Pangeo to manage our files. There are two ways to do this: (1) Navigate to the \"File\" menu, choose \"New\" and then \"Terminal\" or (2) click on the \"terminal\" button in JupyterLab: This will open a new terminal tab in your JupyterLab interface: Now you can issue any Linux commands to manage your local file system. Now let's clone a repository (Note: we'll be teaching about Git clone during our introductory tutorials). This tutorial is built in a repository called \"preliminary\", so let's try cloning that. First, navigate in a browser on your own computer to the repository link here . Next, click on the green \"clone or download\" button and then copy the url into your clipboard by clicking the copy button: Now navigate back to your command line in JupyterLab. Type \"git clone\" and then paste in the url: A note about cutting and pasting Pasting something from your clipboard into the Pangeo terminal requires holding down the \"shift\" key and right-clicking. This is different from the usual Linux method that only requires a right click. After issuing the Git clone command you should see something like this: You may also upload files from your local system using the upload button (up-pointing arrow) on the top left of the JupyterHub navigation panel.

(First time only: Grant the ICESat-2 Hackweek Organization permissions - this grants you access to the Pangeo computing environment for the Hackweek.) Step 3 Start the Pangeo computing environement. It may take a few moments to start up. Get a local copy of the tutorial and follow along This basic workflow allows you to follow along with tutorials and save changes to your fork while staying up-to-date with any changes made to the master tutorial. Step 1 Navigate to the tutorial repository on GitHub . Fork the tutorial repository to your personal GitHub account via the GitHub web user interface. For example, https://github.com/friedrichknuth/geospatial-analysis forked from https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/geospatial-analysis. Step 2 Clone the forked tutorial to your machine/Pangeo environment. You can easily copy the link to a repository by selecting the green \"clone or download\" dropdown and hitting the clipboard icon, which will automatically copy the link for you. Open a terminal (using the \"plus\" sign in your Pangeo JupyterHub) and execute: $ git clone https://github.com/friedrichknuth/geospatial-analysis.git $ cd geospatial-analysis Note: a more detailed version of step 2, including images, is available as part of the Preliminary Steps - JupyterHub Connection . Step 3 Add the upstream master (a link to the tutorial repository you forked) so we can stay up to date with any changes made to the main tutorial. $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/geospatial-analysis.git Step 4 Fetch and merge the latest changes from upstream master. $ git fetch upstream $ git merge upstream/master Step 5 Checkout a branch to make changes and follow along with the tutorial. $ git checkout -b branch_name Step 6 Follow along with the tutorial. You are welcome to make changes and notes as you go, and these will be saved to your forked copy in the next step. Step 7 Commit your changes and push them up to your fork, under your branch. $ git commit -am \"A short commit message noting what you have changed here\" $ git push origin branch_name Now your fork will have your changes backed up to GitHub under your branch. If additional changes were made to the upstream master tutorial, you can checkout the master branch $ git checkout master and repeat step 4 to get the latest content, then checkout a new branch with a different name and follow along from there.
